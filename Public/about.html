<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Oyedele Yusuf, a student for Abiola Ajumobi Technical University. I hail from Ibadan and study Software Engineering and aspiring to be a fullstack web developer</p>

<p>I bought a code on Udemy just because the name is "Software Development", I regretted this action but later came to learn that no knowledge is wasted.</p>

<p>I later got lucky to buy Dr Angela's course which is gradually changing my life. Thank you!</p>
